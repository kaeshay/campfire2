Hello Dalal, I noticed that Dirar has been asking to add obstacle courses to campfire. I think it would be helpful if Dirar had access to materials that he can use to create his own obstacle courses (e.g. pencil & paper/obstacle cones/pillows/clay/pipe cleaners etc.). Would you be able to provide him with or situate him in a room where he can easily access things he can use to create them?
